# Accounting System Pro
## ENGG1340 Group39

### Problem Statement
Managing financial status easily on the user’s system is a trend nowadays. We aim to develop an accounting system to help users keep track of their financial status without spending much time and provide some financial advice such as setting daily budgets.

### Problem Setting
- Users record their expense and income frequently
- They would like to keep track of detailed and overall financial status and would like to set some budget plans to regulate their life
- They would also like to seek advice when special events happen and additional expenses are needed
- Since there’s no enough database for us, we assume that the currency rate will remain as a default value

### Program Features
The designed program will contain the following features: 
1) **Add records of income and expenses:**
   - The record of different currency will be calculated into the major currency
   - Simple calculations(add, subtract, multiplication, and division) are allowed
2) **The records can contain some basic information:**
   - Amount
   - Equivalent amount(for foreign currency)
   - Date
   - Types of income or expense(such as food, transportation, salary and so on)
   - Account (such as cash, bank card, and credit card)
3) **The records could be deleted and edited at any time:**
   - Records of a whole day could be deleted at once
   - Nearest deleted data will be able to resume
4) **Users could view their records by date, type, and account** 
5) **The system will provide a statistical report of users’ financial status to help users measure their budget plans:**
   - Monthly income and expenses
   - Percentage of different kinds of expenses
   - Top 3 daily expenses 
6) **The system allows budget setting:**
   - Alerts when expenses reach the budget (or the set percentage of the budget)
   - Different weights can be applied to different days (like more budgets on the weekends than the weekdays)
7) **The system allows users to simulate a special event in the month. Users enter planned expense of an event and the system will tell the user:**
   - The total amount the user has saved in this month（which is the total amount of the difference between daily budget and daily expense)
   - The amount needed to be saved in the rest of the month
   - Advised daily saving amount
